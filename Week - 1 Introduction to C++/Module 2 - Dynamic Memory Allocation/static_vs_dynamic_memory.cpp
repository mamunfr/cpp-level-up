//Static memory-
                //basically we call it stack memory
                //sometimes called compiletime memory
                //Stack memory limited,ekbar declare korle size ar baranu jay na
                //er por stack memory auto memory clear kore dey, for example
                //main() and fun(), fun() theke main() e return howar por, fun() delete hoye jay

//Heap memory-
               //we call it dynamic memory
               //sometimes called runtime memory
               //More memory
               //auto delete hoy na, user instructed memory
               
    //Better practice, when we declare a dynamic variable or array we should delete that also
    //because it doesnt get delete by itself unless user tell it too...altho when we close application
    //it deletes by itself
