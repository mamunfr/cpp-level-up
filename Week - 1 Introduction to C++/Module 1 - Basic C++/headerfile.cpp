// we normally use specific header file for specific requirment, such as-

#include<iostream>
#include<algorithm>
#include<iomanip>

//but its hard to remember and sometimes we might not sure when to use what, so
//c++ has a combined header file, which include al header files and that is-

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
